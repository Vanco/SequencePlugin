## Experimental features
**The experimental features created by myself, which is not part of UML standard. Use this feature in your own risk.**

### UAST support (since version 3.x)
SequenceDiagram version 3.x will use UAST api to generate sequence diagram.

Refer to ['The UAST description from IntelliJ Platform SDK'](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/uast.html)

> UAST (Unified Abstract Syntax Tree) is an abstraction layer on the PSI of different programming languages targeting the 
> JVM (Java Virtual Machine). It provides a unified API for working with common language elements like classes and method 
> declarations, literal values, and control flow operators.
> 
> Which languages are supported?
> - Java: full support
> - Kotlin: full support
> - Scala: beta, but full support
> - Groovy: declarations only, method bodies not supported

> **Note**
: There are some limitation when generate from scala or groovy code. Refer to the list of [known issues](#known-issue).

### Smart Interface
Find the implementation of the interface smartly.  e.g.
```java
public interface Fruit {
    int eat();
}

public class Apple implements Fruit {
    @Override
    public int eat() {
        return 5;
    }
}
```
`Apple` implemented the `Fruit` interface. When we generate sequence diagram for the `eatFruit` method:
```java
public class People {
    
    private Fruit fruit = new Apple();

    public void eatFruit() {
        fruit.eat();
    }
}
```
I draw dummy `implementation call` in dash line.

For the interface or abstract class, if there is only one implementation found, it will draw in diagram automatically. 
More than one implementation, you need to choose one to draw. this is an option in settings.

### Lambda Expression
No standard for the lambda expression in the sequence diagram yet. So I create mine. e.g.
```java
public interface Service<Int, String> {

    String invoke(Int a);
}
```
 I need draw the sequence diagram for `hello` method:
```java
public class Lambda {

    public Service<Integer, String> hello() {
        return a -> {
            Fruit fruit = new Apple();
            fruit.eat();
            return "I'm good!";
        };
    }
}
```
I draw a dummy `() ->` self call in diagram.

## How to use
Sequence Diagram can generate sequence diagram from JAVA, Kotlin, Scala, Groovy File.
1. Open Java/Kotlin/Scala/Groovy file
2. Generate SequenceDiagram with shortcut `Alt S` for windows, `Option S` for macOS

Please try to experience it and find what happen. 

Have fun!

## Known issue

#### 1. Scala for comprehension calls is not supported
For example:
```scala
class B() {
  def bar() = Option("bar")
}

class A(b: B) {
  def foo() = {
    val r = "foo" + b.bar().getOrElse("?")
    r
  }

  def foo2() = {
    val r = for {
      x <- b.bar()
    } yield "foo" + x
    r.getOrElse("?")
  }
}
```
the for comprehension call
```scala
val r = for {
      x <- b.bar()
    } yield "foo" + x
```
it's UAST tree is `UastEmptyexpression`.
```
 UMethod (name = foo2)
            UBlockExpression
                UDeclarationsExpression
                    ULocalVariable (name = r)
                        UastEmptyExpression(type = PsiType:Option<String>)
                UReturnExpression
                    UQualifiedReferenceExpression
                        USimpleNameReferenceExpression (identifier = r)
                        UMethodCall(name = getOrElse)
                            UIdentifier (Identifier (getOrElse))
                            ULiteralExpression (value = "?")
```
so the `b.bar()` method call will not generate base on `UastEmptyexpression`. Hopefully, the UAST api will solve this problem sooner.

#### 2. Groovy method body is not supported
For example:
```groovy
/**
 * A Class description
 */
class Student {
    /** the name of the person */
    String name

    /**
     * Creates a greeting method for a certain person.
     *
     * @param otherPerson the person to greet
     * @return a greeting message
     */
    //known issue: groovy method will not generate in UAST
    String greet(String otherPerson) {
        "Hello ${otherPerson}"
        // call java
        Fruit fruit = new Banana()
        fruit.eat()

    }
}
```
Based on UAST api limitation, it's UAST tree is no method body mappings.
```
UFile (package = van.demo.grovvy)
    UClass (name = Student)
        UMethod (name = greet)
            UParameter (name = otherPerson)
```
When generate sequence of method `greet`, the calls in the method body will not generate (the call java code in the body of `greet`).
```groovy
        "Hello ${otherPerson}"
        // call java
        Fruit fruit = new Banana()
        fruit.eat()
```

#### Why change name?
Since 2011, I found a solution of NPE of original **SequencePlugin**, so I write email to Kentaur with my solution,
He said he was not coding anymore. Instead, he sent me the code. I fix the NPE issue and publish to plugin
repository with new name **SequencePluginReload**.

In 2015, the IntelliJ change the login system, and I lost my account, cannot continue to publish new version to
the repository.

In 2016, I change the Name again to **SequenceDiagram** and host the source code on [github](https://github.com/Vanco/SequencePlugin).
Now it is open source.

Thanks Kentaur for the great work on the original source.
